## VTCRO-SEC-Jetson

This is a development environment for creating ROS applications. This environment includes GUI features for debugging and developing such as:
- Gazebo
- Rviz

# Prereqs 

If on a Windows computer install WSL Ubuntu before continuing. 

Before trying to use this workspace make sure you have the nvidia container toolkit installed and docker installed on your system.

To install Docker:
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y

sudo apt-get install docker.io
```

To install the nvidia container toolkit:
```
curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg \
  && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/deb/nvidia-container-toolkit.list | \
    sed 's#deb https://#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://#g' | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
```


# How to Build

Prerequisites:
- Docker Desktop
- WSL (if windows)

Note: The jetson has an ARM processor, so if you're trying to set up this environment on the jetson, you will need to use the Dockerfile in the balena directory.

Build the image using

```
docker build -t vt-cro/ros-env .
```

Before running the container, make sure to run the command `xhost +local:` on your host system (if you're on a Linux system). This will grant the container to access your host's X server, allowing you to run graphical applications such as rviz or gazebo. No further setup is needed if running with a Windows or Mac hsot.

Finally, you can run the container by running `launch.sh` shell script if you have a gpu and the `launch_no_gpu.sh` if no gpu is present in your system
Place your workspace in `./src/` and you will be able to access it within the container at `/home/ros/ws/`.

# How to Build Workspace
Navigate to the workspace (`/home/ros/ws`) and run the following commands to install all required dependencies for the ROS workspace:

```
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
sudo apt update
source install/setup.bash
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```

If the above doesn't work, try
```
sudo apt update
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```

If there is no ```/src``` directory, make one. Then run those commands again.

Clone the SEC-CRO-JETSON repository into ```/ws```
```
git clone https://github.com/VT-CRO/SEC-CRO-JETSON.git
```

Then navigate to the SEC-CRO-JETSON directory you just cloned and build the workspace. To do so, you must ensure to build the packages in the following order. The commands are as follows:
```
colcon build --packages-select btcpp_ros2_interfaces behaviortree_ros2 crobot_msgs
source install/setup.bash
colcon build
```
This will take a while.

Now source the workspace again, and is is ready to use.

# Tips for Troubleshooting

When using `colon build' if you get a permissions error, do the following:
```
cd 

chmod 777 ws/
```

Then try again.
